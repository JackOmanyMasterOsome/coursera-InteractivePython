coursera-InteractivePython
==========================

Mini-Projects worked on for coursera - Interactive Programming in Python
Mostly mini-games and stuff assigned to us as part of the coursera classes ([here](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-004))

Enjoy!

## NOTE
- The pieces of code here use libraries (SimpleGUI) from the [CodeSkulptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)
- I am pretty new to it, so for now, the code will only run on the online browser based Python IDE at [Codeskulptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org/), which only does not not not works on IE
- Since the classes are currently live, I will only be pushing the codes only after they have been evaluates.


## How To
You can follow any one of the two options below to enjoy some mini-games:
- Copy the code from the appropriate folder in the repo and directly paste into the code box in a fresh [CodeSkulptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) window/tab.
- Click through the link to my submission provided for each week's mini-project, below.
